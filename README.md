on graph one we want to show the audience  Land Cover classes of Rwanda , through this piechart audience may know what are the classes of rwanda land by hovering on any part of this piechart(land cover class name) this part is interactive because after hovering user is able to see the area(Ha),and its percentage. Hillside agricultural land is one with big size with 53.1%, and protected wetland is the one having small with 0.5% as seen on our piechart 


on graph 2 we have a bar chart that shows the harvested area by crop type per district(ha),on y-axis we have values of crop name and in x-axis there is district , here we want to show the harvested crop according to the area or district that is cultivated . by interactivity user can use the dropdown to select any crop that he/she needs and can compare it with different district . for example you can see that maize is mainly harvested in Kirehe district . user can interact with this using that dropdown.

in each column there are other 3 columns: overall,SSF,SITE respectively. by using the drop down the user can interact with our Dashboard by selecting one of the percentage of the farmers by agricultural practices and this may help him/her to compare them according to the districts
